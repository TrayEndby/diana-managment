      <p className="">
        This Privacy Statement describes the types of information Kyros AI Corp., collects through our websites,
        including the website at www.Kyros.ai (our “Sites”), as well as all related websites, networks, applications,
        and services provided by us and on which a link to this Privacy Statement is displayed (collectively, together
        with the Sites, our “Offerings”). This Privacy Statement describes the information that we gather from you on
        our Offerings, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information. For
        purposes of this Privacy Statement <b>“Personal Information”</b> means any information that may be used, either
        alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited
        to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address or other information.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Information We Collect</h2>
      <p className="">
        When you use our Offerings, we may collect information about you, including your name, contact information,
        billing information, geographic area, or preferences and we may link this information with other information
        about you. You may provide us with information in various ways through our Offerings. For example, you may
        provide us with information when you order or register to use features of our Offerings, use our Offerings,
        request information from us, or send us customer service-related requests.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        When you use our Offerings, we may collect certain information automatically from your device, including
        information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad
        geographic location and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device has
        interacted with our Offerings including our Sites, the pages accessed and links clicked. Some of this
        information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        Third-Party Buttons. We may implement third-party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may
        function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party
        web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third-parties, not by Kyros. Information collected by a
        third-party in this manner is subject to that third-party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        Information from Other Sources. We may obtain information from third-parties, such as our partners and
        advertisers, and from other sources outside of our Offerings, including from certain offline sources such as
        trade shows.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Data</h2>
      <p className="">
        Kyros engages commonly-used website navigation and information gathering tools, such as cookies and web beacons,
        to collect information as you navigate our Offerings. Kyros and our affiliates use these cookies or similar
        technologies to analyze trends, administer our Offerings, track user’s movements around our Offerings, store
        preference information in our Offerings, serve targeted advertisements, and gather demographic information about
        our user community as a whole.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Cookie Notice</h2>
      <p className="">
        Kyros AI Corp. uses cookies across our Sites to help improve our performance, to enhance the user experience and
        to support some key site functionality. Which cookies we use, and what we use them for is detailed below.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Cookies and Cookie Types</h2>
      <p className="">
        Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer by websites you visit. They allow the website to
        do things such as keep track of your preferences as you move around the site so that the website can personalize
        pages for you and store little bits of information about your visit for use on future visits. Cookies stay on
        your computer for varying amounts of time depending on their type and the parameters the website sets whilst
        creating them.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        Cookies come in three different types. The cookies themselves vary very little between the types but their
        effect and use are different.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">First Party Cookies</h2>
      <p className="">
        First party cookies are created by the website you are visiting. They can only be read and used by that website.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Third Party Cookies</h2>
      <p className="">
        Third party cookies are not set by the website you are visiting. They are set by a different organization whose
        features are being used by the website you are visiting. This is common practice if sites use analytical systems
        supplied by a third party (as most are) to track the usage and load on their website. These may also be created
        by embedded content in the web page, a YouTube video for instance, as these need their own cookies to work.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        A third party cookie may also be used by an advertising provider to track your usage of the website and to
        customize the adverts you receive. As you move between sites that use the same advertising provider, these
        cookies can allow the provider to track you across these various sites and gain an insight into your internet
        usage.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Session Cookies</h2>
      <p className="">
        These enable a website to track your use throughout the site, storing choices you have made and any information
        you have provided. They are a type of first party cookie that only remain stored on your computer until you
        close your browser when they are then deleted.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Disabling Cookies</h2>
      <p className="">
        Each browser has settings which allow you to elect not to allow websites to store cookies on your machine. As
        each browser is a little different, we advise you to check your browser’s help functionality for this option or
        search for instructions that are specific to your browser. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of our
        Sites may not function as intended.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data</h2>
      <p className="">
        Our Sites, like most websites, gathers certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and
        administer our Offerings.  This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server
        you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your
        browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your
        searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your
        usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use our Offerings, we automatically receive
        the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave our Offering.  This
        information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve our Offerings, to track and aggregate
        non-Personal Information, and to provide the Offerings.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Social Media Features and Single Sign-on</h2>
      <p className="">
        Kyros AI Corp., our Sites and Offerings may use social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button
        (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our
        website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such
        Social Media Features to post information about your activities on our Offering to a profile page of yours that
        is provided by a third-party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Social
        Media Features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Offering. Your interactions with
        these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.
        Kyros AI Corp., also allows you to log in to certain of our Sites and Services using sign-in services. These
        services authenticate your identity and may provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us
        such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Collection, Use and Ownership of Statistics</h2>
      <p className="">
        Kyros AI Corp. may monitor your input and use of our Sites and Offerings, and the servers and other equipment
        used by you for this purpose. We may collect and compile statistics based on your input and use (“Statistics”).
        Ownership of the Statistics, and the associated intellectual property in the Statistics, shall belong to Kyros
        AI Corp. Kyros may use the Statistics in an aggregated and anonymized manner, including to compile statistical

        Statistics publicly available and use the Statistics in compliance with applicable law.

            accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal
            Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal
            Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

      <p className="">
        Residents of California have the right to request a disclosure describing what types of Personal Information we
        have shared with third-parties for their direct marketing purposes, and with whom we have shared it, during the
        preceding calendar year. You may request a copy of that disclosure by contacting us.

      <h2 className="text-primary mb-3">Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p className="">
        Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Kyros. Our Sites are general audience
        websites not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from
        children under the age of 13 without obtaining parental consent. If you are a parent or guardian of a child
        under the age of 13 and believe we have collected information belonging to a child under the age of 13, please
        let us know by contacting us at{' '}

        </a>
        . (The age consent may be older than 13 in certain countries and you must be at least that age if you are using
        our Sites in any of those countries. Accordingly, if processing of Personal Information is based on consent,
        Kyros will not knowingly engage in data processing for users who are under that age under the age of consent.)

        and indicate the date of the latest revision. In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights
        or obligations here-under, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send
        a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you
        access one of our Offerings for the first time after such material changes are made. Where permitted, your
